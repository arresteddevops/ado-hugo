Description = "At DevOpsDays Ghent in 2014, it was joked that we are living in a 'post-DevOps world'. What are the challenges in hiring for DevOps related jobs? We be talked with panelists on all sides of the table - recruiting, hiring, and also just some rabble-rousing about why you should stop looking for 'ninjas' and 'rockstars'. Digital Ocean's Jill Jubinski, Datadog's Mike Fiedler, and rabble-rouser Josh Hertz joined Matt and Trevor to weigh in on a this complicated topic."

<h2>Check-Outs</h2>
<h3>Jill</h3>

<h3>Josh</h3>

	<li>I’m officially the SysAdmin for <a href="http://www.causticsodapodcast.com/" target="_blank">Caustic Soda</a>, which is a podcast about horrible things. It’s like Mythbuster for all that is gross and horrible. Now that I think about it, I can’t recommend it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://influxdb.com/" target="_blank">Influxdb</a> is an open-source, distributed, time series database with no external dependencies. Currently in Alpha (v0.8.8) it's going through a major refactor, the "production ready" version v0.9.0 is due out this month. The ease of installation and setup is what sold me on it. I think it has a lot of potential, so we'll see how v0.9.0 looks when it's released.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.thebruery.com/" target="_blank">The Bruery</a>:  Briefly mentioned. Small batch, high quality beers out of Placentia, Ca. Their barrel aged and sour beers are outstanding. I recommend Loakal Red as the gateway beer for those that like IPAs.</li>
