Definition of a hot take - “a piece of commentary, typically produced quickly in response to a recent event, whose primary purpose is to attract attention.”

Charity Majors (Honeycomb), Jill Jubinski (Fastly), and Eric Sigler (PagerDuty) sit down with Matt to have some fun with a few great DevOps "hot takes" and talk about what everyone is doing wrong.
