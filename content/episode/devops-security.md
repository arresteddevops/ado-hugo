Description = "When we talk about DevOps, often times we focus only on the two disciplines that feature in the name - Development and Operations. But DevOps, truly, is about collaboration across all areas of the business, even those security blokes. Ben Hughes, Security Manager at Etsy, joins the ADO crew to review how to work WITH your security teams, and show that they're not really scary at all."
