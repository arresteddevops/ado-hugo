Matt, Trevor, Bridget, and Joe discuss 2017.

## What were some of your favorite episodes?

- Bridget: the GOTO Chicago eps were fun! And I love the 1-1 fireside chats.
- Trevor: I enjoyed the Twitter banter around getting the live call show with Dr. Nicole Forsgren going, sad I had to miss it! There’s also a ChefConf episode sitting on my Surface that I just found the charger for!
- Matt: The Live call in show with Dr. Nicole Forsgren. Also the recent fireside chat with J. Paul Reed. And the crazy-go-nuts overload show of Windows Stuff.
- Joe: Live eps were easier to edit.
