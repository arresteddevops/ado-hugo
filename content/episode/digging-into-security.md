Security: the one topic that’s guaranteed to turn any DevOps conversation into a mix of fear, eye rolls, and nervous laughter. In this episode of Arrested DevOps, Matty welcomes back Kat Cosgrove to talk about the “never not hot” world of security and why it’s always lurking just over your shoulder (like that one compliance auditor who swears they’re just “observing”).

Kat and Matty cover:

- Why vulnerabilities never seem to stop showing up in your containers (spoiler: they don’t).
- How teams can respond without spiraling into full-blown panic.
- The realities of securing Kubernetes and containerized environments (without pretending there’s a magic “easy button.”)
- Why security culture matters as much as the tools you’re using.

Along the way, expect the usual mix of snark, sarcasm, and the occasional tangent about how everything in tech eventually becomes a security problem.

If you’ve ever patched the same vulnerability three times in a week, or found yourself yelling at a CVE like it’s a personal enemy, this one’s for you.
