[Devopsdays Madison 2017](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-madison/) was the second year for this event. With great speakers, workshops, open spaces, and sponsors, this event brought the community together to learn and share. 

Bridget and Matt sat down with a speaker (Emily Freeman) and a couple of organizers (Joshua Zimmerman & Christian Herro) to talk about the wider themes of organizational change when you may not call all the shots in your org.

* Emily Freeman's talk: [Scaling Sparta: Military Lessons For Growing A DevOps Team](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-madison/program/emily-freeman/)
