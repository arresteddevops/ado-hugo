### What happened in 2019?

#### Bridget
Switched from devrel to product. Helped with Helm 3 launch!!! Traveled less. Dragged Joe to a personal trainer because if he’s going maybe I will too.

#### Matty
Lots of speaking (spoke at 24 conferences in 2019). Moved back to Chicago. Went to lots of devopsdays. Got even more interested in resilience engineering and realized I don’t know shit. 

#### Trevor
More travel! A lot of customer work, focus on delivering solutions, now moving officially into product. I also got really into shuffleboard and DND

#### Jessica
Consulting!
