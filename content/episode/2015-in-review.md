title = "2015 in review"
Description = "We’ve made it through two years of ADO! It seems like only yesterday that we recorded our first year-end episode (which you can listen to at arresteddevops.com/27). And we’re back again to talk about what 2015 was for us, in the world of DevOps, and the world of ADO. Plus, Matt and Bridget wax nostalgic about cable management from when we managed data centers."

## ADO Updates

- No new hosts added this year, but it’s the first full year being “staffed up”, whatever that means
- We sometimes do eps without all the hosts! Which allows for a bit more scheduling flexibility
- Redesigned the website! This means now if you find errata in the show notes, etc, you can go right ahead and send the fixes to us via pull requests at [github.com/arresteddevops/ado-hugo](https://github.com/arresteddevops/ado-hugo)
