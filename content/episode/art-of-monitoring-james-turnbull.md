Don't forget to check out the book itself! *[The Art of Monitoring](https://www.artofmonitoring.com/)*.

Back in the day, James also wrote a book called *[Pro Nagios 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/Nagios-Experts-Voice-Open-Source/dp/1590596099)*.

Three stages of monitoring maturity:
- Manual, user-initiated, or no monitoring (aka Bridget’s example of “we know things are broken because the customer calls us to complain”)
- Reactive
- Proactive

"You will eventually get to CPU, memory, and disk, but a lot later after you start with the things you should really care about" - James

"Too much monitoring is binary - this thing either works or it doesn’t" - James
