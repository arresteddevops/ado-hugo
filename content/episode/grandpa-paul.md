Matt refers to an episode of “Coupling” on the BBC - the episode was [Series 1, Episode 2, “Size Matters”](https://iamnotfrodo.wordpress.com/2008/05/05/coupling-ep2-size-matters/) - here’s the quote:

**Patrick:** Oh, don’t be so piecey.<br />
**Howard:** Typical lefty puritan..<br />
**Sally:** Typical what? Come the revolution-.<br />
**Patrick:** What revolution!? You guys are in power! We’re the revolution now!.<br />
**Sally:** No. No, it can’t be right...<br />
**Patrick:** You’re the evil empire..<br />
**Sally:** No!.<br />
**Howard:** Yes! Like Star Wars, and Patrick and me are the Rebel Alliance..<br />
**Sally:** No! You’re not the goodies, we’re the goodies! We’re lefties!! We’re always goodies!.<br />
**Patrick:** *puts glass on his mouth and makes a Darth Vader voice* No, Sally. You’re the establishment.
