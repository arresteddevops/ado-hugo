Matt, Trevor, and Bridget chat (at length) about podcasts, podcast recording, and podcast recording software. Oh, and the highlights of 2016 if they get around to it. (Don't miss the supercut of all 2016's cold opens, which was edited by Joe, even though Matt takes credit for it!)

### Other improvements
- Matt did a session with Daniel J. Lewis of the [Audacity to Podcast](https://theaudacitytopodcast.com/) (we were a featured podcast eval in [Podcasters Society](https://podcasterssociety.com/)) and we got a whole bunch of ideas on how to improve the show - some of which we have already started to implement). You can check out our outstanding issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/arresteddevops/ado-hugo/issues)
- Welcome to Joe as our main audio editor!

### What happened with you in 2016?

#### Matt
- Didn’t travel much - only spoke once twice - once at Pink16, and once at a Cloudbees conference in Chicago
- Only went to one devopsdays - Chicago. I’m failing!
- Hey, I got married

#### Bridget
- 28 talks. Give or take. A few of those were at devopsdays - I made it to London, Toronto, New York, Detroit, Havana, Philadelphia, Madison, Sydney - and of course ran Minneapolis.
- Counting North America Joe and I hit 5 continents this year. And I was going to travel _less_. Instead, all the airline status. Rethinking next year. Maybe get into webinars?
- Devopsdays: growing! New core team! New cities!

#### Trevor
- I spoke 3 times this year, but got to attend so many more conferences than before
- I was literally on the other side of the planet to my usual place of existence for the first time. 
- I moved to LA
- I work for Chef now!
