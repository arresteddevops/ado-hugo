### 90s Sci-Fi Roundup

[Joe's Babylon 5 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz2x7erqNZw&feature=youtu.be) at DevOpsDays Madison 2016

#### Joe's Top Babylon 5 Episodes

- Season 1, ep 3: *[Born to the Purple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_the_Purple)*, Great Londo episode. 
- Season 2, ep 20: *[The Long, Twilight Struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long,_Twilight_Struggle)*. End of the Narn/Centauri War. One of the best FX shots of the whole show. One of the best Londo/G’Kar eps.
- Season 3, ep 20: *[And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_the_Rock_Cried_Out,_No_Hiding_Place)*. More good Londo/G’Kar.
- Season 4, ep 14: *[Moments of Transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moments_of_Transition)*. End of the Minbari Civil War. Good Delenn ep, better Neroon ep.
- Season 5, ep 8 *[Day of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead_(Babylon_5))*. Duh.

#### Joe's Worst Babylon 5 Episodes

- Season 1 ep 10: *[Believers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believers_(Babylon_5))*. Basically Christian Scientists in space. I could have chosen *[TKO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKO_(Babylon_5))* (*Bloodsport* in Spaaace!) or *[Infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_(Babylon_5))* ("He took a pretty bad hit!"). *Believers* is super-preachy and it has the pedigree of being written by David Gerrold (wrote the tribbles ep of original recipe Trek)
- Season 2 ep 18: *[Confessions and Lamentations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_and_Lamentations)*. A deadly plague threatens the Markab. Another weak Dr. Franklin ep. Also, a deadly plague, read the room B5!
- Season 3 ep 18: *[Walkabout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkabout_(Babylon_5))*. Hey, look! It’s Wallace’s mom from Veronica Mars but oh, god, the songs!
- Season 4 ep 10 *[Racing Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Mars)*. Marcus AND Dr. Franklin together on Mars! Nuts and gum, together at last. Honorable mention: *[The Deconstruction of Falling Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deconstruction_of_Falling_Stars)*.
- Season 5 ep 11: *Phoenix Rising*. Fucking telegoths.
