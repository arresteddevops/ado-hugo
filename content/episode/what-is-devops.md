[DevOps – the Title Match](http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2013/06/04/devops-the-title-match/) – John Vincent’ blog post about what DevOps is and isn’t, that Matt totally read from and referred to.

[Food Fight Show](http://foodfightshow.org/) – The Podcast where DevOps chefs do battle. These guys totally watched this live. Which is more than I can say for [The Ship Show](http://theshipshow.com/). Just kidding.
