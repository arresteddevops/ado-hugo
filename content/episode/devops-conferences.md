title = "Conference Love"
Description = "Conferences - some people are addicted, and others have never been. What is the point of conferences? What's an unconference? Why shouldn't I just stay home and watch the livestreams? Jason Dixon (Monitorama), Bridget Kromhout (devopsdays Minneapolis), and Pete Cheslock (devopsdays Boston) give their two cents (and more) about why conferences are the place to be."

<ul>
	<li>What was the first tech conference you attended?</li>
	<li>What are things you get from a conference that you cannot learn other ways?</li>
	<li>How can I maximize my value out of attending a conference?</li>
	<li>If I’m going to a conference where I don’t know anyone, how can I still have a good time?</li>
	<li>You both have planned conferences. What are some of the things that go into organizing that people might not be aware of?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite conference story?</li>
	<li>How do you learn about new events to attend?</li>
	<li>How do you pick which events you know about to go to? There are a lot, and it can be hard to narrow down when you only have a 1-2 conference limit from an employer, or your own resources.</li>
	<li>What was the coolest piece of “swag” you got from a conference?</li>
	<li>Does the swag at a conference weigh in for you at all? I hear a lot of noise around the big Google events because everyone knows they are walking away with hardware.</li>
	<li>Lets talk about conference etiquette, and discuss some of the points in <a href="http://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/2014/09/22/four-interactions-that-could-have-gone-better/" target="_blank">Bridget's article</a></li>
