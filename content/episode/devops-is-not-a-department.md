Description = "DevOps is not a department. It's a set of concepts and ideas that are human-centric and driven through Agile practices. It's applying Big A Agile to operations: fast feedback loops, deeper collaboration with stakeholders (which is the engineering team), and invoking people over process and tools. A current problem hamstringing organizations is that they treat DevOps like a commoditized department: one that writes shell scripts and deploys Jenkins servers, and not the value engine that those teams could be. They took the tools team, applied a light version of DevOps ideology, and said, \"Hey, that's it. That's DevOps. Hashtag winning.\""
