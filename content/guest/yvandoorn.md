Yvo van Doorn has more than a decade of system administration experience. The first part of his career, he manually built out and configured bare-metal servers. He’s a strong believer in the culture change that comes with DevOps. When he isn’t busy spreading the gospel of Chef, he’s probably enjoying a hoppy IPA, exploring the great outdoors, or celebrating his Dutch heritage while eating a wheel of gouda and watching Oranje lose the World Cup. Yvo lives with his wife and black lab in Seattle, Washington.
