Currently I am enjoying life as a Developer Advocate with Bridgecrew (by Palo Alto) specialising in Cloud and Infrastructure Security Automation. Prior to this I was a Solution Architect for StackRox and Aqua Security specialising in container and kubernetes security and also previously spent several years Synopsys establishing DevSecOps best practices for enterprise CI/CD pipelines.

I also have killer new podcast called CoSeCast - The Continuous Security Podcast, a personal blog and podcast called Codifyre, and represent Great Britain at playing Ultimate Frisbee.
