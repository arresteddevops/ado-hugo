Ryn Daniels is a senior operations engineer at Etsy who got their start in programming with TI-80 calculators back when Geocities was still cool, and these days has opinions on things like ‘the cloud’ and ‘devops’. Before escaping to the world of operations, they spent a few years doing R&D and systems engineering in the corporate world. They live in Brooklyn with a perfectly reasonable number of cats, and in their spare time can often be found rock-climbing or hand crafting knitted server koozies for the data center. They are co-author of O’Reilly Media’s [Effective DevOps](http://oreil.ly/1BXuIdX).
