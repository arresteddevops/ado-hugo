Alice Goldfuss is a systems sorceress. She’s consulted on some books (Docker: Up & Running, Effective DevOps), presented at some conferences (SREcon, Velocity, Container Summit), and runs some others (LISA17, DevOps Days Portland). You can follow her on Twitter (@alicegoldfuss), but you’ll probably regret it.
