A 28-year-old beer drinker. A sparkly devops princess. A philosophy. A quest for a beer-ops-work-life-bourbon-happiness-dev-beer balance. Loving the work being complained about and the process of complaining. Brewing beer and making a perfectly reasonable amount of hot sauce. Post-devops. A pink-haired thought leader. Available for parties, weddings, bar mitzvahs, and bar crawls.
