Annie Hedgpeth is a cloud automation engineer at [10th Magnitude](https://www.10thmagnitude.com/), and spends her days using [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) to help move companies to [Azure](https://www.10thmagnitude.com/azure-magnitude-planner). She has written extensively about Chef&#39;s security automation tool [InSpec](https://www.inspec.io/) on [her blog](http://www.anniehedgie.com/) in hopes of making the framework more accessible to non-developers. She continues an ongoing interest in DevOpsSec and hopes to play a role in moving security left. She is also excited to be a part of 10th Magnitude&#39;s ever-expanding reach in the world of [DevOps](https://www.10thmagnitude.com/solutions/devops-automation-continuous-delivery/) and [Cloud migration](https://www.10thmagnitude.com/solutions/azure-migration-and-data-center-transformation/).
