Dan is a veteran of the dotcom bubble, and has been variously a system administrator, university lecturer, start-up founder, and day labourer. As a member of the Devopsdays Core team, he has had the privilege of speaking and keynoting at events around the world. Today, he is a Developer Advocate at Datadog, a role that mixes two of his great passions: measuring things, and talking about measuring things.
