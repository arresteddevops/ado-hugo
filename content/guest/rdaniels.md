Ryn Daniels is an operations engineer and sparkly devops princess whose goal in life is to never again be a one-person ops team. They live in New York where they spend far too much time in the data center and not enough time making hot sauce and homebrewing beer. Ryn is not a member of any pink-haired thought leadership conspiracy which emphatically does not exist.
