Working Mom, a huge Arizona Wildcat Alumni and knows a thing or two about humans and matching them to the right Engineering role. I say all the things my engineers want to say about all the things they can not because of unsafe places. Advocate for those without a voice in the company and on the street. I got you.

I specialize in developer tools, cloud computing and anything from the interface layer to the data center.
