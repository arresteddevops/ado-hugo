My name is Dagna Bieda and I’m a Software Engineer turned Career Coach. I’ve been coding for 10+ years, and coaching for the past 3+ years. I’m the tough love “I’ve been in your shoes“ kinda Coach.

I worked with an incredible range of clients thus far, some from big brand names (such as LinkedIn, Amazon, Google, Disney), as well as much smaller businesses. And their experience ranging from 2-20 years of experience, and education ranging from self-taught, through career-changing Bootcamp grads, to college grads, some with a military background, I’ve helped them reach for their potential, through getting crystal clear on their personal definition of “fulfillment”, strategically planning next steps, and shifting their Engineering Mindset.
