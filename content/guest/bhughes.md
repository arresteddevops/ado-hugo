Ben Hughes is not a CTO, is not an award winning thought leader, nor an accomplished playwright. He is however a senior security engineer at Etsy. Before that he was breaking operations at Puppet Labs. He&#39;s also pretended to be a build engineer for cold hard cash, but he&#39;d really rather not talk about it. He&#39;s spoken at conferences throughout the world on subjects such as security, devops, and security and devops.
