I am a system administrator with PagerDuty. Along with rest of our team, I try to design systems that can withstand major outages. Before joining PagerDuty, I worked at Google, ThoughtWorks etc, where I was working with private build/deployment cloud, also enabling continuous delivery &amp; cloud adoption. I did my masters in Life Science (Bioinformatics), and I always try to create infrastructure like living systems.
