As a teenager, John moved from Chicago to a small, ultra-conservative midwestern town where dancing and Rock and Roll music had been banned. Against all odds, he successfully lead a rebellion to abolish the outmoded ban, winning the heart of the ministerâ€™s daughter along the way. Currently, Mr. Smyth is a Senior Consultant with 10th Magnitude.
