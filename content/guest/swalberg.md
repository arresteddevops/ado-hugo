Sean is a problem solver: a software developer that loves applying software principles to infrastructure automation and web applications. Sean wanted to program most of his life, realized he didn’t like it during his first job, spent 13 years as a network guy that wrote a lot of code, joined an awesome web startup as a web developer, and has rediscovered his joy for software development. After that ended, he moved into a more devops type role where he can have his feet in both camps. He's currently with a consulting company that’s responsible for the infrastructure and applications at a large American sporting league.
