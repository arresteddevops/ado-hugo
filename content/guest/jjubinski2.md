Jill Jubinski is a recruiting veteran with over 6 years of recruiting experience in the community. She received her Masters in Industrial/Organizational Psychology with plans to change the way organizations treated their employees. When that didn’t work out she started recruiting ;-) Jill leans on her strength in relationship building as a jumping off point to help organizations build amazing teams and genuinely cares about the health and wellness of an organization’s culture. She is also known to chat incessantly about her dogs and give hugs like they are going out of style.
