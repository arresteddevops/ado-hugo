Kevin Reedy is an infrastructure developer from Chicago that currently works for Kong (not the dog toy company) as a Senior Technical Account Manager. In his free time, he enjoys playing shuffleboard (the kind you'd find on the deck of cruise ship), brewing beer, snowboarding, and promising that heâ€™ll update his blog more often.
