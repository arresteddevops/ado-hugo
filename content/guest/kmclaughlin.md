Katie has worn many different hats over the years. She has been a software developer for many languages, systems administrator for multiple operating systems, and speaker on many different topics.
When she&#39;s not changing the world, she enjoys cooking, making tapestries, and yelling at JavaScript and its attempt at global variables.
