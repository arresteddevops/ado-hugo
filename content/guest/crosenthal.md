Casey Rosenthal is CEO and Founder of Verica; formerly the Engineering Manager of the Chaos Engineering Team and others at Netflix. He wrote the definition of Chaos Engineering, started the conferences, wrote the canonical book on the subject, etc. He has experience with distributed systems, artificial intelligence, translating novel algorithms and academia into working models, and selling a vision of the possible to clients and colleagues alike. His super-power is transforming misaligned teams into high performance teams, and his personal mission is to help people see that something different, something better, is possible. For fun, he models human behavior using personality profiles in Ruby, Erlang, Elixir, and Prolog.
