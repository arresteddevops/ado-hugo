I've been in the tech recruiting game for about 4 years. I got my start recruiting linux sys admins at Rackspace and started slowly creeping up the chain to Linux Sys Engineers (the DevOps of RAX) and Developers. 4 months ago I made a huge move to DigitalOcean to build their recruiting department from the ground up. So I get to run things however I want, muahahhahaha. I like twitter, A LOT, and my dog Noodle. :-)
