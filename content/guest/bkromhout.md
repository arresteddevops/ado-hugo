Bridget Kromhout is an operations engineer at [DramaFever](http://dramafever.com/), the largest streaming video site for international content. She’s been paying the bills with Unix sysadmin work since the last time ‘flannel shirt over babydoll dress’ was a trendy look. Her CS degree emphasis was in theory, but she now deals with the concrete (if ‘cloud’ can be considered tangible). She likes finicky wide-column data stores, stats-driven monitoring, formal grammars, bicycle-powered camping, and butchering pumpkins for home canning. In her spare time she helps organize her local [AWS meetup](http://aws.mn/) and [devopsdays Minneapolis](http://devopsdaysmsp.org/).
