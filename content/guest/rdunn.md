Reuben Dunn is the DevOps Practice Lead at Fraedom - a payment, expense and travel SaaS platform. Reuben is influencing a transformation around continuous learning, scientific experimentation and Fraedom&#39;s newly formed SRE team. Reuben started in the Windows Ops space cutting his teeth on a DEC server running NT Server 3.51, before moving into development roles after needing to script users into AD. In the development roles, he found himself doing the build &amp; deploys, then found belonging in the DevOps Space. Reuben is passionate about a sustainable transformation for DevOps in the windows space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Reuben enjoys life with his wife and 4 kids on a rural section in the south-east of Auckland. Reuben is also the lead organiser for DevOpsDays Wellington which ran earlier this year.
