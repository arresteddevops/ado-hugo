Timothy Gross is a product manager for Joyent, providers of the Triton Elastic Container Service. Tim previously ran Ops at DramaFever, where he and his scrappy team ran Docker in production to serve a few million fans their daily dose of dramas, documentaries, and gross-out horror movies. In a previous life, Tim was an architect (buildings, not software). He took the leap into programming and operations after he discovered he could automate away almost everything boring in his life.
