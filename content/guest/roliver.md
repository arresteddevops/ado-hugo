Rin is a Technical Community Builder at Camunda. They enjoy discussing all things open source, with a particular focus on diversity in tech, improving hiring pipelines in OSS for those that are neurodivergent, and removing accessibility barriers to learning programming. Rin is also a Member of Kubernetes, a contributor to Spinnaker, involved in the Kubernetes Contributor Experience SIG, and is a Storyteller on the Kubernetes Upstream Marketing Team. When not immersed in all things OSS and cloud-native, they can be found hanging out with their wife and pets, making candles, cooking, or gaming.
