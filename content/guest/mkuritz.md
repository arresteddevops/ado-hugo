Matt is a staff engineer, and the tech lead of the Platform Engineering team at The Farmer's Dog. Prior to The Farmer's Dog, Matt worked in a variety of companies and roles, but has always helped with the adoption of devops culture and practices.

Outside of work, Matt has served as an organizer of devopsdays in New York City since 2018. He is currently interested in learning more about resilience engineering, and facilitating learning from incidents. The rest of his time is spent playing tug with a very goofy white swiss shepherd named Ze'ev.
