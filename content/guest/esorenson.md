After 16 years working as a systems/network administrator in the Bay Area, Eric relocated to Portland in 2012 to further develop his passion for awesome configuration management tools. When he&#39;s not grooming backlogs for Puppet, he&#39;s out enjoying Oregon&#39;s trails with his partner Jen, son Gunnar, and neurotic-yet-lovable pointer Indigo.
