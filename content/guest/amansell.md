Amy most recently transitioned to the Education and Learning Products team at Lighthouse Labs, Canada's leading developer bootcamp. Formerly the organizer of [the HTML500](http://www.thehtml500.com/), North America's largest free learn to code event, Amy joined the DevOpsDays Toronto organizing team in 2017. When she isn't striving to ship a better education experience at Lighthouse, she spends her time teaching herself to code, playing softball, and lifting heavy things above her head at the gym.
