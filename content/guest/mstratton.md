Matt Stratton is a solutions architect at Chef, where he demonstrates how Chef&#39;s automation platform provides speed and flexibility to clients&#39; infrastructure. He is devoted to concepts like Continuous Delivery and Infrastructure as Code, and his license plate actually says &#34;DevOps&#34;. He lives in Chicago and has an unhealthy obsession with Doctor Who, Firefly, and Game of Thrones. And whiskey.
