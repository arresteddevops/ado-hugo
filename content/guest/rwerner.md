Robert is the CTO of Leapter, where he is focused on solving a critical paradox in modern software development: while AI coding tools promise acceleration, they often amplify the cognitive load on developers through a sprawl of untrusted, hard-to-verify code.

His career has been defined by leading high-stakes technical initiatives: from designing critical systems as a Lead Architect at DHL, to heading product development for a Bosch FinTech spin-off, to driving cloud-native adoption for enterprise customers at Pivotal (later VMware/Broadcom).
