Matty Stratton is the Director of Developer Relations at [Aiven](https://aiven.io), a well-known member of the DevOps community, founder and co-host of the popular [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/) podcast, and a global organizer of the [DevOpsDays](https://www.devopsdays.org/) set of conferences.

Matty has over 20 years of experience in IT operations and is a sought-after speaker internationally, presenting at Agile, DevOps, and cloud engineering focused events worldwide. Demonstrating his keen insight into the changing landscape of technology, he recently changed his license plate from `DEVOPS` to `KUBECTL`.

He lives in Chicago and has three awesome kids and two Australian Shepherds, whom he loves just a little bit more than he loves Diet Coke.
