Michael is a Software Architect at NCR working to introduce devops into their Hospitality organization. Change in large organizations require a lot of political skill, and Michael has learned through trial and error what works and what doesn&#39;t. When pure technical skill wouldn&#39;t suffice, Michael has had to discover the power of his personal brand both internally and externally in order to reach his company&#39;s goals and his own goals.
