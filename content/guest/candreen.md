Currently the Director of Software Development and Application Architect for the MacArthur Foundation, I grew up on the Dev side of technology. I’ve worked for a range of different organizations with a breadth of responsibilities. I’ve worked for a Fortune 100 insurance company with plenty of corporate culture focused on BI enablement to a small startup where I was responsible for all things technology related. I believe in using the right tool for the right job and try hard not to be biased towards specific technology stacks. In my current role, I am working hard to take the lessons I’ve learned and apply them to a place whose goal is to make the world a better place.
