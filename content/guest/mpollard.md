After a couple of decades in the ISP, Web Hosting and Cloud Industry as a sysadmin / Infrastructure Coder, Mick Pollard joined the Australian Government's Digital Transformation Agency to help build clearer, simpler, faster public services.
Mick's focus is on building the next generation hosting platform that allows digital transformation teams to operate safely at speed.
Mick co-founded Devops Sydney along with Lindsay Holmwood in Feb 2010 - a monthly meetup for ideas and knowledge sharing around helping development and operations work more efficiently together rather than in silos.
When not tapping at a keyboard Mick can be found chasing the many kangaroos off his property or helping the local community as a first responder with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.
