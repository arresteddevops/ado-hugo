After a couple of decades in the ISP, Web Hosting and Cloud Industry as a sysadmin / Infrastructure Coder, Mick Pollard joined the Australian Government&#39;s Digital Transformation Agency to help build clearer, simpler, faster public services.
Mick&#39;s focus is on building the next generation hosting platform that allows digital transformation teams to operate safely at speed.
Mick co-founded Devops Sydney along with Lindsay Holmwood in Feb 2010 - a monthly meetup for ideas and knowledge sharing around helping development and operations work more efficiently together rather than in silos.
When not tapping at a keyboard Mick can be found chasing the many kangaroos off his property or helping the local community as a first responder with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.
