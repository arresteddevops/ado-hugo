I love teaching people to code. I have been employed in the tech industry since 2014, holding multiple software engineering positions at startups, and a distinguished faculty role at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.

I [blog](https://welearncode.com/) a lot about code and my life as a developer. My blog posts have had over well over a million reads and have been featured on DEV's top 7, the top spot on HackerNews, FreeCodeCamp, and in JSWeekly. You can hear about new posts on my [newsletter](https://ebook.welearncode.com/).

I also have a podcast with two other incredible women: [Ladybug Podcast](https://ladybug.dev/). We talk about the tech industry, our backgrounds, and go in depth on code-topics.

When I'm not coding you can find me watching my favorite New England sports teams, taking runs around Capitol Hill with my dog [Blair](https://www.instagram.com/blairnugget/), or rock climbing.
