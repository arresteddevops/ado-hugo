I am currently working for [Bluechip Consulting Group](http://www.bluechip-llc.com/) as a Solutions Architect helping to implement various security related and automated OS migration solutions. I spent most of my career supporting Web Developers by both developing build and release solutions and generally as a Linux Systems Administration. Over the years I have seen the benefits first hand of the DevOps way. Which has lead to my focus on getting Ops and Developers working together for the benefit of the companies I have worked with and for. I have worked for various sized companies from Fortune 500 companies like GE and Chrysler all the way down to dot-com start-ups and three man web development shops. They all gain in productivity and profitability with DevOps powering their profit engines.
