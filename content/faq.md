*How can I be a guest on the show?*<br />

Please just send us an email to shows [at] arresteddevops [dot] com or fill out the [contact form](/) with your name and the topic you would like to talk about on the show! The more details you have about your idea, the better!

*How can I suggest a topic for the show?*<br />

## Event Media Sponsorship

*What do I get out of having ADO be a media sponsor for my event?*<br />

We will mention your event on episodes leading up to it, along with the URL for registration (likely provided via a shortURL for easy remembering) and we will also tweet about your event (with the discount code) and promote the event via the drawing/contest by which we give away the ticket(s) you provided.

*What do I need to provide to ADO in exchange for media sponsorship?*<br />

1. Display the ADO logo on your event's page as a "media sponsor" along with whatever else you do with media sponsors on marketing materials for your event.
2. Provide ADO with a discount code for your event. The amount of discount should be 20%. Please also use the discount code `ADOYYYY` (ex: `ADO2019`), as it gets confusing for our listeners if there are multiple codes across events.
3. *OPTIONAL* Provide ADO with at least one free ticket to your event that we will give away via a contest of some kind to a listener.

If you want to set this up, send us an email at shows [at] arresteddevops [dot] com.

## Sponsoring Arrested DevOps
*I'm interested in having my company or organization sponsor ADO. What do I get out of sponsorship?*</br >

1. An approximately 30 second message read during the episode (we don’t hold you tight to the length, just something that sounds not too awkward and long). You can provide a different creative for each episode if you want.
2. A landing page to whatever URL you specify. This landing page is consistent (i.e., arresteddevops.com/bluthcompany would always point to whatever URL you specify, it shouldn’t change per-episode. The reason for this is because the short arresteddevops.com landing page is memorable for people who are listening, and not clicking on links, etc)
3. A thank you/shout out on the episode page on our site, including a banner if you would like.

*How much does sponsorship cost?*<br />
We provide single episode pricing, as well as 6 or 12 pack episode packages for a discounted rate. We also will discuss a per-conversion package with you as well. Please see our [sponsorship page](https://www.arresteddevops.com/sponsorship) for details.
